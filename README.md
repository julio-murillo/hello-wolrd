First repository... just following the guide
I'm a software enthusiasts... supposedly an engineer but I have been way from coding for a while now, but I think is like riding a bike, once you learn how to do it, you'll never forget. Of course, this doesn't mean you are going to win a race but with a little practice you can come back and that's what I intent to do.
